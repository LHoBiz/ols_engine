--------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the beta version of the OLS Engine v0.2.
--------------------------------------------------
Release date: 4 April 2016.

OLS Engine allows you to generate your own
Obstacle Limitation Surface (OLS) for your own viewing
in Google Earth.

Google Earth or Google Earth Pro must be installed.

OLS Engine relies on data input from you in order to
generage the OLS. This input data is standard for any OLS.

In order to generate your OLS, simply answer the questions
that OLS Engine asks and follow the guidance provided
within the questions. Google Earth is a great source of
data to answer some of these questions.

OLS Engine will finally ask you how high you wish to
set the resolution of your OLS model in square metres.
E.g. entering 100 means OLS Engine will generate your
OLS with 100 metre square cells. The smaller the number,
the greater the height accuracy but larger the KML file,
and vice versa.

IF YOU RUN INTO ANY ISSUES because of BAD input data,
close the program and restart OLS Engine. This step
should get you back on track.

Once OLS Engine opens your OLS model in Google Earth, you may
customise the style settings, e.g. surface colour, transparency etc.
